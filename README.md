### Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Studying the internal structure of these algorithms to comprehend why certain decisions are being made is not straightforward. Classification algorithms like the Support Vector Machine are challenging to study and interpret, which is why they are often referred to as "black boxes."

With SVC, after rescaling the data, the accuracy gains an impressive boost. However, i still haven't used a classification algorithm that provides us with its internal rules so that we can understand how certain decisions are made.

There are algorithms that display a sequence of decisions based on the provided data, such as a car having fewer miles driven and being newer, and how these decisions influence classification in a kind of "decision tree". Such classifiers are called decision tree classifiers. There are several algorithms of this type, i will use the default DecisionTreeClassifier from SKLearn.
